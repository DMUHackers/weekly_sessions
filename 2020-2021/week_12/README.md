# Week 12 - Juice Shop and XSS

In this week’s session we will be looking at cross-site scripting using juice shop.


You'll need to host the vulnerable Juice Shop site to try the XSS attack challenges against.


If you haven’t got Juice Shop set up from our previous sessions, use the following guide we made.
